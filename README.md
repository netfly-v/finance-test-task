Real-time rendering prices (websocket + redux)

A solution to display price tickers data on the UI in realtime.

User can see prices changing up or down and can add favorite tickers to watchlist in app's header.

Technologies used:
- React with hooks
- Typescript
- Redux with thunks
- Socket.io
- unit tests
- styled components

We will assess the next parts:
- workability: how your application works
- projects structure: how you structure your files
- code quality: how you write clean, readable code (feel free to install and use ESLint and Prettier)
- knowledge React and its ecosystem: how you compose and use libraries together
- testing: how you can test your code

## Running the local service
1. Open a new bash shell
2. ```cd server```
3. ```npm install``` or ```yarn install```
4. ```npm run start``` or ```yarn start```
5. You can visit [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000) to check that the service is working correctly and inspect the data it produces.
